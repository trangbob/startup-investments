# startup-investments

A startup's financing cycle includes typical stages as:
1, Seed/Angel funding round: the startup raises the first flows of capital for its first few years of operation
2, Series A: the startup survives the first years and wants more funds to expand its business
3, Series B+: the startup continues to raise larger funds from bigger investors
4, IPO: a method of exit which happens when the startup has been extremely successful, and decides to sell its shares to the public.

Question to Answer:
What are the differences between startups which went to Series A and startups which stopped at Angel?
